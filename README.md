Project Title : GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK APPLICATION: BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Faculty : Prof. Henry Choi (Indiana University)

Abstract

With the increased ability to process large datasets through distributed computing, Network science has emerged to provide solutions to some of the existing issues in different domains. By decoding the interactions between the components of the network, the collective behavior of a system can be studied and visualized in greater depth. Bioscience (genes and proteins), social networks (friends and family), communication networks, power grids, trade networks, and other fields have utilized Network science methodologies with great success and successfully discovered new patterns and knowledge. Our study investigates the interaction between users and products using Graph Neural Networks in order to learn users' usage behavior and suggest products to buy. Our experiments were conducted using the Amazon book open dataset between 2016 and 2017. Both human-centric and metric-based evaluation methods were applied to evaluate two different approaches based on a Unipartite and Bipartite graph.
